Database Schema Plan
Notes Table:
id (uuid, primary key)
header (text, required)
body (text, required - will store rich text content)
tags (text array)
importance (enum: 'low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical')
created_at (timestamp with time zone)
updated_at (timestamp with time zone)
created_by (uuid, references auth.users)
Relationship Tables:
note_phases (note_id, phase_id)
note_meetings (note_id, meeting_id)
note_workstreams (note_id, workstream_id)
note_initiatives (note_id, initiative_id)

Implementation Plan

‚úÖ Phase 1: Database & Backend - COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Created database tables using Supabase MCP
- ‚úÖ Set up RLS policies for security (no permissions needed for single user)
- ‚úÖ Created TypeScript types for the new entities
- ‚úÖ Added Supabase queries for CRUD operations
- ‚úÖ Created custom hook (useNotes) for state management
- ‚úÖ Added full-text search functionality
- ‚úÖ Created database views for efficient querying
- ‚úÖ Added indexes for performance optimization

‚úÖ Phase 2: Core Notes Components - COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ NotesContainer - Main container component with state management
- ‚úÖ NotesList - Display all notes with filtering/search
- ‚úÖ NoteCard - Individual note display with metadata and actions
- ‚úÖ NoteForm - Create/edit note form with validation
- ‚úÖ RichTextEditor - Basic rich text editor component (placeholder for Phase 3)
- ‚úÖ NotesFilters - Filtering by importance, tags, dates, and entity types
- ‚úÖ NotesSearch - Search input with debouncing
- ‚úÖ NotesView - Main view component for routing integration
- ‚úÖ Navigation integration with main sidebar
- ‚úÖ Routing setup in App.tsx
- ‚úÖ All console errors resolved and components working properly

Phase 3: Rich Text Editor
Implement basic formatting (bold, italic, lists, links)
Add mention parsing for @people, #tasks, !meetings
Create mention components with clickable links
Store content as HTML or markdown (your preference?)

Phase 4: Entity Connections
Add connection fields to note form
Display connected entities on note cards
Allow editing connections when editing notes

Phase 5: Search & Discovery
Full-text search across notes
Filter by connected entities (phases, meetings, etc.)
Filter by tags, importance, author, date
Search results highlighting

Phase 6: Navigation & Integration
Add Notes to main navigation
Integrate with existing sidebar
Add quick note creation from other views
Cross-reference display in connected entities

Some more context:
1. Notes should be saved as markdown as its cleaner
2. There is an initiative Table you can review in the supabse MCP
3. For now let's skip the quick note creation and consider it for a later addition.
4. No permissions issues for now, I am the only user.

## Phase 1 Implementation Details

### Database Tables Created:
- `notes` - Main notes table with all required fields
- `note_phases` - Junction table for notes ‚Üî phases
- `note_meetings` - Junction table for notes ‚Üî meetings  
- `note_initiatives` - Junction table for notes ‚Üî initiatives
- `note_workstreams` - Junction table for notes ‚Üî workstreams

### Database Views Created:
- `notes_with_relationships` - Shows notes with all connected entities
- `notes_by_entity` - Shows notes grouped by entity type

### Full-Text Search:
- Created search index on notes header + body
- Added `search_notes()` function for efficient searching
- Supports ranking and relevance scoring

### TypeScript Types Added:
- `Note`, `NoteWithRelationships`, `NoteFilters`
- `CreateNoteData`, `UpdateNoteData`
- Connection types for all entity types

### Supabase API:
- Complete CRUD operations for notes
- Relationship management
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Entity-specific note retrieval

### Custom Hook:
- `useNotes()` hook for state management
- Handles loading, error states
- Provides all CRUD operations
- Manages filters and search

### Documentation Updates:
- ‚úÖ Updated `documentation/data/data-architecture.md` with notes system
- ‚úÖ Updated `documentation/data/ai_agent_database_guide.md` with notes system
- ‚úÖ Added notes system to implementation priorities
- ‚úÖ Documented integration points and user flows

## Phase 2 Implementation Details

### Components Created:
- **NotesContainer**: Main orchestrator component managing state and layout
- **NotesList**: Grid display of notes with empty state handling
- **NoteCard**: Individual note cards showing metadata, content preview, and actions
- **NoteForm**: Modal form for creating/editing notes with validation
- **NotesFilters**: Sidebar filters for importance, tags, dates, and entity types
- **NotesSearch**: Search input with debounced API calls
- **RichTextEditor**: Basic editor placeholder (to be enhanced in Phase 3)
- **NotesView**: Main view component for routing integration

### Key Features Implemented:
- **Responsive Layout**: Grid-based note display with sidebar filters
- **Search & Filtering**: Full-text search with debouncing and multiple filter types
- **Form Validation**: Required fields and proper error handling
- **State Management**: Centralized state management with custom hooks
- **Modal Forms**: Clean create/edit interfaces with proper validation
- **Tag Management**: Add/remove tags with visual feedback
- **Importance Levels**: Visual importance indicators with color coding
- **Entity Display**: Show connected phases, meetings, initiatives, and workstreams

### UI/UX Features:
- **Card-based Layout**: Clean, modern card design for notes
- **Importance Badges**: Color-coded importance levels (low, medium, high, critical)

### Next Steps:
The Notes system is now fully functional with a complete UI for creating, viewing, editing, and managing notes. The next phase will focus on enhancing the RichTextEditor with:
- Basic formatting (bold, italic, lists, links)
- Mention system (@people, #tasks, !meetings)
- Clickable mention links
- Markdown support and rendering
