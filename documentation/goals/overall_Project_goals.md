## üèóÔ∏è Key Architectural Decisions

### **1. Meeting Template System**
- 16 meeting types with pre-structured JSONB templates
- Auto-copy mechanism from meeting_types to meetings.template_data
- Dual JSONB structure: template_data (plan) + structured_notes (actual)
- Meeting objectives field (renamed from learning_objectives)

### **2. Task Hierarchy & Classification**
- Parent-child task relationships via parent_task_id
- 10 task types including "Phase Milestone" for critical decisions
- Source tracking: planned tasks (source_meeting_id = NULL) vs action items
- Multi-workstream assignment capability

### **3. Phase Milestone Evolution**
- **DEPRECATED:** phases.key_milestones JSONB field
- **NEW:** Milestones stored as tasks with task_type_id = 9
- Benefits: Assignable, trackable, status management

### **4. Initiative Structure**
- Mix of weekly and ongoing initiatives
- Overlapping timelines to reflect parallel workstreams
- Rich key_focus descriptions reflecting transition context

```sql
-- Create meeting with template auto-copy
INSERT INTO meetings (phase_id, meeting_type_id, meeting_name, template_data, meeting_objectives)
SELECT phase_id, meeting_type_id, meeting_name, template_structure, 'objectives'
FROM meeting_types WHERE meeting_type_id = ?;
```

### **For Task Creation**
```sql
-- Create phase milestone
INSERT INTO tasks (phase_id, task_name, task_type_id, due_date, owner_id)
VALUES (?, 'Critical Decision Point', 9, '2025-10-01', ?);

-- Create action item from meeting
INSERT INTO tasks (phase_id, task_name, source_meeting_id, task_type_id)
VALUES (?, 'Follow-up action', meeting_id, 7);
```

### **For Progress Tracking**
- Use status fields consistently: scheduled ‚Üí completed
